en-GB,line:Intro,"Hello Emily and Jonathan.  Thank you both for coming together to talk about what happened earlier today. Emily would you like to tell me what happened? #line:0c273a6
Jonathan was saying that my family don’t have any money and they don’t care about me. #line:051c6bd
That’s very upsetting.  How did that make you feel Emily? #line:019f51f
Emily:  It made me cry. I felt embarrassed. Everyone was laughing. I wanted to go home and not come back to school.  #line:01c1039

<<set $girlVoiceLine=2>><<girl_talk DialogueRunner>><<girl_NPC_finish_talking_wait DialogueRunner>>Teacher: I’m glad you brought this to my attention and that you were both able to come together with me to talk about this.

<<activate_voice_recognition DialogueRunner>><<wait_for_speech_recog DialogueRunner>>Jonathan: Well, I noticed that Emily never has dinner in school like the rest of us.  She always sits on her own to eat a packed lunch.  I was only teasing her. #line:0fde08d
