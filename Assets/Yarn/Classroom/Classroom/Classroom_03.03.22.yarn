Nothing really, I was only joking. #line:0f767a6_char2_Jonathan
<<NPC_finish_talking_wait DialogueRunner>>

//<<activate_voice_recognition DialogueRunner>>
//-> 1. You like to have a laugh with your friends do you? #line:0c23aa5 
//-> 2. I don't think it was very funny. #line:042d98e 
//-> 3. It was actually quite a mean thing to do. #line:0611d90 

//Jonathan: 
<<set $characterToTalk to "Jonathan">>
<<NPC_start_talking DialogueRunner>>
Yeah I suppose. #line:02f5115_char2_Jonathan 
<<NPC_finish_talking_wait DialogueRunner>>

//<<activate_voice_recognition DialogueRunner>>
//-> 1. So what was it about this particular incident that made you laugh? #line:0de75b1 
//-> 2. What about this did you find so funny? #line:0ed7664 
//-> 3. Why were you laughing? #line:09d329d 

//Jonathan: 
<<set $characterToTalk to "Jonathan">>
<<NPC_start_talking DialogueRunner>>
Well, I noticed that Emily never has dinner in school like the rest of us. She always sits on her own to eat a packed lunch.  I was only teasing her. #line:0fde08d_char2_Jonathan 
<<NPC_finish_talking_wait DialogueRunner>>

<<activate_voice_recognition DialogueRunner>>
-> 1. So you thought that maybe you could have a joke with everyone? #line:0528951 
-> 2. And you thought that was funny? #line:04723f4 
-> 3. So someone sat alone is a joke to you? #line:007578c 

//Jonathan:  
<<set $characterToTalk to "Jonathan">>
<<NPC_start_talking DialogueRunner>>
Yeah I guess so.  I didn't mean to make her cry. #line:01b3826_char2 
<<NPC_finish_talking_wait DialogueRunner>>

<<activate_voice_recognition DialogueRunner>>
-> 1. I understand, so tell me what happened.  #line:06ffdee 
-> 2. But that is what she did. What exactly did you do? #line:0a7eb91 
-> 3. How did you make her cry? #line:03bd949 

//Jonathan:  
<<set $characterToTalk to "Jonathan">>
<<NPC_start_talking DialogueRunner>>
Well, I shouted over to Emily, having sandwiches again then Emily!  Then everyone kind of laughed.  So I carried on for a bit.   #line:0ecee7a_char2
<<NPC_finish_talking_wait DialogueRunner>>

<<activate_voice_recognition DialogueRunner>>
-> 1. How were you feeling at that time?  #line:0691990 
-> 2. Why would you say something like that? #line:0cce363 
-> 3. That doesn't sound very funny to me. #line:04ce51d 

//Jonathan: 
<<set $characterToTalk to "Jonathan">>
<<NPC_start_talking DialogueRunner>>
I guess I thought it was funny because everyone else was laughing.   #line:009ec7c_char2 
<<NPC_finish_talking_wait DialogueRunner>>

<<activate_voice_recognition DialogueRunner>>
-> 1. How did you feel when Emily started crying? #line:02a2781 
-> 2. Why did you carry on when Emily was crying? #line:049e040 
-> 3. And what was Emily doing while you were all laughing? #line:01ae2c3 

//Jonathan:  
<<set $characterToTalk to "Jonathan">>
<<NPC_start_talking DialogueRunner>>
I didn’t really notice.  I guess I was to into it to pay attention.   #line:0e6f05a_char2 
<<NPC_finish_talking_wait DialogueRunner>>

<<activate_voice_recognition DialogueRunner>>
-> 1. So you were caught up in the moment? #line:0756cd3 
-> 2. You didn't notice Emily crying at all? #line:05c8a3f 
-> 3. So you carried on though Emily was crying? #line:023b85f 

//Jonathan:  
<<set $characterToTalk to "Jonathan">>
<<NPC_start_talking DialogueRunner>>
I guess so. #line:057be74_char2 
<<NPC_finish_talking_wait DialogueRunner>>

<<activate_voice_recognition DialogueRunner>>
-> 1. How do you think it made Emily feel?  #line:09b1d34 
-> 2. What do you think about it all now? #line:06536ca 
-> 3. Do you really think that was a nice thing to do? #line:0c3e774 

//Jonathan:  
<<set $characterToTalk to "Jonathan">>
<<NPC_start_talking DialogueRunner>>
I guess I shouldn’t have done it.  I didn’t mean to make her cry. #line:0f5fa06_char2
<<NPC_finish_talking_wait DialogueRunner>>

<<activate_voice_recognition DialogueRunner>>
-> 1. Emily, is there anything you would like to say to Jonathan? #line:02b18fa

-> 3. Emily, why didn't you stand up for yourself? #line:01b0fdd

It's because I have diabetes that I can’t eat certain foods, so my Mum packs me a lunch to keep me safe. #line:02f45c7_char1
<<NPC_finish_talking_wait DialogueRunner>>

<<activate_voice_recognition DialogueRunner>>
-> 1. That’s a really lovely thing for your mum to do Emily.  #line:053ece2

I do feel bad.  I didn’t mean to upset her and I should have listened.   #line:0c2970b_char2

Yeah I won’t do that in the future, I will listen more. #line:0c7cdaf_char2
