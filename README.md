## Adapting for Your Project

* What you'll need to do
* Essential elements

### Microsoft Azure Text to Speech

The Microsoft TTS setup is based on [Active Nick's Unity-Test-To-Speech project](https://github.com/ActiveNick/Unity-Text-to-Speech). By adapting his Speech Manager script, it is possible to call realtime TTS from the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services.

To implement this in your project, you will need to set up (at least) a [free account with the Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/cognitive-services/) which will permit up to 5000 requests per month.

Once your account has been set up, you will then find your 'Speech Service API Key' and 'Speech Service Region' in the Keys and Endpoint section of your account portal.

This will then need to be added to each Speech Manager script in the Inspector window.
